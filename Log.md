# Meeting Roadmap

- **27-11 App and contract testing**

    - Todoes for next meeting:
    >
    > Give the buyer the possibility to upload money in installments
    > 
    > Let the seller automatically get the money once there is compliance
    >
    > Give the Fintech a percentage-based return instead of a fixed one
    >
    > Add some more integration between the contract and the front-end app
    >
    >
    > Start exploring the voting system in Solidity


    - What we improved since previous meeting:
    >
    > Improved the front-end: now different people from different PCs and metamask accounts can interact with the smart-contract. It also automatically stores in the contract the hashed IPFS version of the documents that the seller and the buyer upload
    >
    > Added the time element to the contract 
    >
    > Checked the severity of the security issues in the contract (changing Solidity to 7.5 solves the most relevant ones)
    >


- **20-11 App and contract testing**

    - Todoes for next meeting:
    >
    > Keep figuring out how to manage external inputs in the contract and how to create a front-end app
    >
    > Keep improving, refining and double-guessing the contract and what it does/what it should do


    - What we improved since previous meeting:
    >
    > Unified the different .sol files and adapted the code so that it's more choesive
    >
    > Tested the prototype and improved it (adding more content to it)
    >

- **16-11 First Prototype**

    - Todoes for next meeting:
    >
    > Better understand Solidity and how to interact with something 'external'
    >
    > Start working on a convenient front-end app
    >
    > Improve the basic prototype 

    - What we improved since previous meeting:
    >
    > Created and tested a new basic prototype with a central Fintech
    >

- **14-11 Professor Feedback**

    - Todoes for next meeting:
    >
    > Start implementing a basic prototype of a Letter of credit blockchain environment in which a centralized Fintech handles everything (basically digitalize the process)
    >


    - What we did
    >
    > Thourough discussion with the professor of what we thought of so far. New inputs on how to proceed and where to go
    >

- **10-11 Brainstorming**

    - Todoes for next meeting:
    >
    > Schedule a meeting with the professor to assess the validity of the ideas and to start working on the one which gets approved
    >


    - What we did:
    >
    > Discuss and refine the proposed ideas and solutions
    >


- **05-11 Kick-off**
    - Todoes for next meeting:
    >
    > Study the material and papers
    >
    > Familiarize with the topic
    >
    > Propose ideas and discuss them in the shared file


    - What we did:
    >
    > Discuss the topic
    >
    > Think about ideas and implementations on how to improve the process related to the letter of credit
    >
